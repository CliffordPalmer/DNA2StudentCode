Nearly all our proposed solutions involved iterating through the entire DNA sequence while simultaneously checking for repeats of STR |

Instead of using .equals, to use another way to compare the STR to a section of the sequence in constant time. The idea that I came up with was to change a list of characters into an integer by assigning a number to ATG and C, and creating an int based on that. I then spent the rest of the class implementing this solution. Another way to speed things up, is instead of rehashing a section of sequence from scratch, one can just delete the fist letter and add the next. This saves a bit of time for cases with long STRs |

I got to a point where all my cases were working within the time limit EXCEPT testLargest |
| Oct 14  | 9:30-10:00pm  | It took a while to figure this bug out. It's difficult to debug, because the debugger doesn't load due to the sheer size of the sequence. I tried a bunch of different things, before eventually diving into exactly what testLargest was testing. I realized that it was just a string of a's, and realized that in the case that all the letters in the sewuence are the same, I never actually set the int for max repetitions. A quick if statement after my main forloop solved this. Now all my cases work, but testLargest is hovering right at 20 seconds. Something I caught wind of in class was to use bit shifting to rehash sections of the sequence. I'm going to try to get this to work. |

The only issue is that I'm not sure how to do the shortcut for rehashing with bit shifting... Either way, bit shifting is A LOT faster. My largest case runs in 9 seconds now! testChromosome22 isn't much faster though, so I think implementing the shortcut rehashing is going to be key to getting that time down. |

It's kind of a new concept to me in general, so I'm having trouble figuring it out. In any case I'm passing all the tests with spare time, and I'll come back to it tomorrow with a fresh mind. |

I got everything working! i just had a small bug in my rehashing function, where I was multipling the first number too many times before subtracting it. With that fixed it works. For this session, I reduced the amount of if statements and used variables to avoid calling the same function too many times, which sped up all my tests. Also finished and cleaned up comments. |
