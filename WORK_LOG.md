Nearly all our proposed solutions involved iterating through the entire DNA sequence while simultaneously checking for repeats of STR |

Instead of using .equals, to use another way to compare the STR to a section of the sequence in constant time. The idea that I came up with was to change a list of characters into an integer by assigning a number to ATG and C, and creating an int based on that. I then spent the rest of the class implementing this solution. Another way to speed things up, is instead of rehashing a section of sequence from scratch, one can just delete the fist letter and add the next. This saves a bit of time for cases with long STRs |

I got to a point where all my cases were working within the time limit EXCEPT testLargest |
| Oct 14  | 9:30-10:00pm  | It took a while to figure this bug out. It's difficult to debug, because the debugger doesn't load due to the sheer size of the sequence. I tried a bunch of different things, before eventually diving into exactly what testLargest was testing. I realized that it was just a string of a's, and realized that in the case that all the letters in the sewuence are the same, I never actually set the int for max repetitions. A quick if statement after my main forloop solved this. Now all my cases work, but testLargest is hovering right at 20 seconds. Something I caught wind of in class was to use bit shifting to rehash sections of the sequence. I'm going to try to get this to work.  |
